        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>For this project, we need to create an application that is related to the domain of <span>Sharing Economy</span>. During the brainstorming state, we found out that many people have formal clothes that are not used often. But they don’t
          want to sell
          them because they might need them one day in the future. Similarly, some people struggle with buying a new set of formal clothes because they wouldn’t wear formal clothes everyday. As a result, we came up with the idea of a <span>formal
            clothing rental</span> app.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Design focus</h2>
        <p>Create an app that allows users to find and borrow formal clothing for short-term usages, such as wedding and Graduation ceremony. Additionally, it also allows users to list their clothing on the platform to lend to other users and earn
          extra money from it.

          <h2>Interviews & Creating Personas for potential users</h2>
          <p><span>Challenges:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Most of the user research can only be done online because of the pandemic.</li>
            <li>All the members of the team are not familiar with Figma.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><span>How we solve:</span></p>
          <p>We created a short survey (5mins) with 8 questions related to formal clothes and sent it to our friends. Additionally, each team member did 1-2 face to face interviews with their family. After gathering all the information, two of the
            team members in charge of analysing the data, the other two members start to find Figma tutorials and start learning. </p>

        <h2>Creating matchmaking web application</h2>
        <p><span>Challenges:</span></p>
        <p>Addressing privacy concern</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The “Make a Post” Page was too long and required users to fill in all the information, which makes the whole process frustrating.</li>
          <li>Users were worry about the authenticity of the clothes they rented.</li>
          <li>Using a shirt figure as a size guide and the lender need to type all the size info would slow down the whole posting process.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span>How we solve:</span></p>
        <p>We separated the page into few different section such as “Listing Description,” “Size,” and “Price” etc. This makes the page less dense and makes the whole process smoother. And we reuqired user to verifiy their identity before they can
          post their clothes on the app.</p>

      <p class="pj-head">Reflection + Takeaways</p>
      <p>Overall, this project was successful because we completed the design focus we identified. This is the first time this course is taught online. However, our team works and communicates well during the pandemic. The comment we got from our
        instructor was that we need more improvement on the visual design and visual hierarchy of the application.</p>
      <h2>Some Takeaways from this project:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Always keep an eye on the visual hierarchy of your design.</span> Visual hierarchy makes it easy for a user to quickly skim the page and distinguish between the important and less important information. </li>
        <li><span>It is a good idea to have onboarding pages for first-time users.</span> Especially in the situation when the user doesn't know where to start by just looking at the homepage of your app.  </li>
      </ul>
